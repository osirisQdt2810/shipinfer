"""``shipinfer plan`` — resolve a chain file into the plan the C++ data plane reads.

The composition ADR-014 describes: the Python control plane validates the chain (ADR-017's
one door) and reads the model repository, then hands the other plane a resolved
configuration. This is that hand-over, spelled as a command so it is reviewable and
diffable rather than happening invisibly inside a launcher.
